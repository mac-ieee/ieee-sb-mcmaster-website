# Welcome to McMaster's IEEE Student Board Website/Commitee! https://www.ieeemcmaster.ca/

This website serves to be a replacement of the currently deployed website, but due to circumstances with COVID-19 and just general busyness, has been left incomplete for a while.

## Currently Built With

* React.js (JavaScript)
* Next.js
* Chakra UI
* Heroku
* Netlify

## APIs Used

* Google Calendar API - to fetch current events from the IEEE Workshops calendar.


# Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

2. Run the Next.js development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
Next, run the Strapi CMS development server (this is required otherwise an error will occur on pages that rely on it.):

```bash
yarn backend-dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site and [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337) to access the Strapi development server
