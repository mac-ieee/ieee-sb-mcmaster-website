# Welcome to McMaster's IEEE Student Board Website/Commitee! https://www.ieeemcmaster.ca/

This website serves to be a replacement of the currently deployed website, but due to circumstances with COVID-19 and just general busyness, has been left incomplete for a while.

## Currently Built With

* React.js (TypeScript)
* Sass
* Chakra UI
* Heroku

## APIs Used

* Google Calendar API - to fetch current events from the IEEE Workshops calendar.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Rebuild website with Next.js instead of create-react-app for improved performance
- [ ] Implement Strapi to manage posts instead of manually having to redeploy every time
- [ ] Add simple in-animations, redesign current theme because I don't really like it
