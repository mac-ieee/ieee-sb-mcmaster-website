# Chapter Page Management

Hello! This is the reference for maintaining your chapter's page on the website.

## Issues and Roadmap

- Currently I am trying to port over the website to use NextJS.
- VSCode Typescript is being very slow in this repo for some reason, if you try to use auto import it will take a while, not sure why.
- If you try and save and reload the app quickly it will sometimes show an error that you've fixed already
