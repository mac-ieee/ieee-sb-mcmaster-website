### Buck Converter Workshop
 Discover the basic working principles of the high efficiency DC-DC step down regulator. Compared to the puny linear regulators, which step down the voltage by converting excess power into heat, the buck converter uses a feedback loop to adjust the switch on ratio (duty cycle) to step down to your desired voltage. By attending this workshop, you will learn all the components that is required to create this switching effect and regulate the output to maintain a steady DC output.
